## [C Programming Boot Camp]

I would like to say sincere thanks to [Paul Gribble] for this super-duper powerful and clean introduction to the world of **C** programming.

For me as a Rubyist this is an excellent foundation of the **C** programming language which also is very helpful to get a better understanding of the **Ruby** internals.
